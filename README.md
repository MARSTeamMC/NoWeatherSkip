### About
In Minecraft, sleeping always skips rain and snow. **NoWeatherSkip** changes this. Now, when players sleep, rain and snow remain and change naturally afterward, but thunder changes to a less dangerous variant.

---
### Features
- Time until the end of weather is now preserved after sleeping.
- Sleeping during thunder changes it to rain or snow (depending on the biome) with the same time until the end.
